I went back to the Multiverse for this project, which is my Rails app for exploring universes and meeting different legendary creatures. It was exciting to add new functionality to the app through JavaScript. I have found JavaScript to be much more challenging to debug and troubleshoot than Ruby. In the beginning, I found myself dropping in binding.pry and then having a moment of mourning when I remembered that won't work here before moving on to other methods. 

It's so exciting to see my progress! I thought JavaScript was much more difficult syntactically, so I was glad to be learning it after I had grasped the bigger picture programming concepts in Ruby. There were many challenging concepts, but they were worth it for the added functionality and better user experience in the end.
