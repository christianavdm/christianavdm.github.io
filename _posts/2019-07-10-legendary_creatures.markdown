The more that I learn about coding, the more fun it is to create apps! It has been so exciting to make this app from the ground up, considering that when I started this bootcamp I had never written a line of code.

I started by drawing the model relationships for this project. Each universe has many creatures, and a creature belongs to a universe. Travelers (my User model) wander through many universes and meet many creatures along the way. Creatures have wisdom, which travelers can collect. 

As I get more practice building apps, I've developed a clearer work flow. I can power through the early phases so much more quickly than when I first started. I quickly set up migrations for all the tables that I needed and dropped into console to play with associations and make sure they were working as I imagined. I made some adjustments and moved on to building my controllers and views. 

The most complicated part of this Rails curriculum has been nested forms and resources. I built all of the creatures as nested resources under universes. I imagine Travelers exploring different universes and meeting the creatures in each one, so it made sense to organize the app that way and helped clarify the concept of nested resources. 

I'm looking forward to expanding my understanding of web apps with the upcoming Javascript projects!
