Sometimes, you know you need to travel, but you don't know (or care) where. Use gtfo to find your next travel adventure.

* You can use a list view by typing go to see the top 5 travel destinations for 2018 according to Travel and Leisure. Type next and/or back to view other destinations. 
* For more details on any destination, type the number of the destination. 
* If you're feeling particularly adventurous, type gtfo to travel to a randomly selected destination. 
* If you get lost, type ? to find a menu.

I had big dreams for this app, but learned quickly to scale them to something manageable. While I intend to create the entire app that I envision someday, it was important to scale this project to what I could realistically complete in the timeframe. 

**Scaling** 

The first big step in this app was finding the appropriate scope. My dream app would scrape multiple websites, including some very challenging ones. I needed to simplify that down. I started by trying to scrape five separate websites, and learned that not all websites are created equal when it comes to scraping. Some of them used only a few css selectors for the entire page, making it very difficult to separate out the different fields.  

In addition, I would like to be able to scrape websites that require input first. For example, I'd like to be able to scrape Google flights, while putting different inputs into the destination and price fields. That is going to be a project for a later date. 

Once I scaled my scraping concept down to a manageable size, it was time for the setup process. 

**Setup** 

The setup process took me a long time, and it was one of the best learning processes of this project. I watched and read many tutorials that broadened my understanding of coding, Ruby, gems, and how all the files work together. Next, I worked on the process of actually setting up my files, folders, and starting to recognize where I need to fill in code. This taught me a lot about the way a computer goes through the files, and what it needs to understand what I'm trying to write. I also spent a long time reviewing Git, Github, and how they interact with my command line. I'm now much more confident using these platforms together. 

**Ruby Coding** 

This is the fun part! It flew by once I could start playing with all my methods in pry. I enjoyed adding in some fun decorative elements. Taking my time on the setup process helped me think through which method belonged in what class, and so writing the code went very smoothly. 

**Editing and Trial and Error" 

After my program was scraping and up and running correctly, I went through and edited everything. I wanted to make sure it was as readable as possible, didn't repeat itself, and was organized well. I double checked that I was meeting all the requirements, and tested all parts of the code. 

Overall, this has been a great learning experience. It's amazing that just two months ago, I had never heard of Ruby, and now I can be loosed upon the world and create my own command line applications. In all fields, it seems people deal with imposter syndrome, but in coding it helps that we can build things and watch them work.
