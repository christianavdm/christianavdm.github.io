I found myself at the end of my twenties at the end of my rope with a dead end job in a dead end career. I was skating on the edge of poverty in the toils and travails of trying to get an arts degree to pay the bills. 

My old decision methodology had gotten me to this point:  

> Follow your passion! Do what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life! 

Who even taught us this? It’s like I absorbed it by osmosis without noticing it doesn’t really make sense. 

I needed a new decision matrix for navigating my career. 

Enter the book *Designing Your Life*, recommended by my best friend. Rather than giving me a new direction, a new set of values, or a new career path, this book gave me concrete skills to create my own. It taught me specific methods to discover what was important to me in life and how to work towards those goals. 

One such method was the Activity Log. For 3 weeks, I tracked all my daily tasks and how engaging and energizing they were. I found that almost all of my work was deeply engaging. As a musician and activist, I chose work that I passionately believed in. BUT- it was completely draining. Each task and each day was sucking energy out of me. I ended my work day utterly exhausted. I had no money or advancement opportunities. I needed a better balance. 

The things that did energize me were surprising! Complicated spreadsheets that made teamwork more efficient. Website redesign meetings. Yoga. (Ok, that last one wasn’t surprising). 

A combination of noticing, re-evaluating, brainstorming, collaborating, and trial-and-error led me to experiment with coding. The question grew in my mind: Can I support myself through a career that is both engaging and energizing, and leaves me enough time to continue music and advocacy? 

Hypothesis: energy + engagement = coding. A (more) balanced life. 

Time to test.
